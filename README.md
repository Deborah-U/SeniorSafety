# SeniorSafety
## üí° Inspiration

* Over 13.3 million elderly people live alone in the US, which puts them at higher risk of injury.
* Falling is the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency rooms, and the primary cause of accidental deaths in seniors ages 65 and older.
* For seniors that live alone, falls can be especially dangerous if no one is aware of the fall or around to help. 
* Covid-19/Quarantine has increased the likelihood that seniors will be living alone.

## üë¥üì± What it does

Senior Safety is a fall detection monitoring system for seniors. Once linked with a webcam, our app provides the following features:
* **Notifications** when their beloved senior has fallen.
* **Monitor** your loved one's activities through their mobile device, once you're set up as a contact.
* **911** will be able to talk to your loved one as soon as the camera detects a fall.
* **Documentation** such as movement recordings, live stream videos, and live audio transcripts will be at your disposal.

## üî® How we built it

**Technologies Used**

_Google Docs & Draw_
* We used google docs during the ideating & brainstorming phase.
* We used Google draw to map out features & MVPs.

_Figma_
* We made the design system & branding on Figma (color, typography, etc.).
* Then, We made wireframes.
* Lastly, We made low & high-fidelity.

_HTML & CSS_
* I **tried** to code some of my screens, but it didn't completely come our functioning, but I did attempt it. :)

**Process**

_I used a design thinking framework._

1. Empathize
2. Define the problem
3. Ideate
4. Prototype
5. Test

* Problem: Seniors that live alone need a better solution to receive fast help when they fall.
* Question (HMW): How might we improve the way seniors (65 & up) receive help when they fall?
* We will need to: Bring an application that allows seniors to have access to 911, as soon as they fall. Also, an application to inform loved ones when an accident has taken place.
* Solution: A mobile application that once connected to local camera/webcams can detect falls, contact 911 & loved ones, as well as documentation of the fall.
* Impact: Seniors & loved ones will feel and be safer, despite living alone.
* Main audience: Seniors (65 yrs & up) and their caretakers/family.
* How our app meets the needs of the various audience: *For seniors* -provides them a safer & more effective way to receive fast help once they have fallen. *For caretakers/family* -provides them peace of mind as they can check on their seniors no matter where they are. Also, they'll be the first to know once their loved one has had an accident.
* Design System: The user interface is clean, simple, and easy-to-use for our target audience (elderly & family)

## üò§ Challenges we ran into

* Finding teammates to create a project with.
* Trying to learn code and implement my designs into code.
* Working on the hack alone, as I am a beginner.
* Time constraints

## üèÜ Accomplishments that we're proud of

* Completing a useful & impactful project on time despite the challenges stated above.
* Completing all screens on time and by myself.
* Making my prototype fully clickable.

## üìñ What we learned

* We learned more about user personas & user research
* We learned more about app design and UI
* We learned about using my research to create the UX
* We learned about design systems (typography, color, branding, etc.)
* We learned a little bit about HTML & CSS even though we weren‚Äôt able to implement them during this hackathon

## üöÄ What's next for _SeniorSafety_

SeniorSafety does not & will not stop at the end of this hackathon! It will continue with the help of developers & investors. So if you, judge, or hackathon participant know anyone wanting to join in the creation of a healthcare app, let me know! **Here's our launch plan:**

**Part I:**

* Finalize platform and recording/detection functionalities.
* Initiate outbound marketing and sales.
* Leverage student & nurse/doctor ambassadors.

**Part II**
* Pilot test in elderly homes/daycares
* Integrate user feedback
* Integrate new features
* Monetize further
